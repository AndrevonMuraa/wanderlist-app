  'france_eiffel_tower': "Standing 330 meters tall, Gustave Eiffel's iron masterpiece was meant to be temporary for the 1889 World's Fair. Parisians initially hated it, calling it an eyesore. Today, it's the world's most-visited paid monument and the heart of Paris. The tower sparkles with 20,000 lights every evening - a sight that takes your breath away.",
  
  'france_louvre_museum': "Home to 38,000 artworks including the enigmatic Mona Lisa, the Louvre is a journey through human creativity. Once a royal palace, this museum's glass pyramid entrance is as iconic as the treasures within. You could spend weeks here and still not see everything - it's that vast, that magnificent.",
  
  'italy_colosseum': "Step into the arena where gladiators once fought for their lives. This 2,000-year-old amphitheater could hold 50,000 spectators who came to witness epic battles. The engineering genius of ancient Rome still stands strong, and walking through its corridors, you can almost hear the roar of the crowds.",
  
  'italy_vatican_city': "The world's smallest country packs the biggest artistic punch. Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling will leave you speechless. St. Peter's Basilica is Christianity's most sacred site. Every corner holds masterpieces that have shaped Western civilization. It's not just a visit - it's a pilgrimage through human genius.",
  
  'spain_sagrada_familia': "Gaudí's unfinished masterpiece has been under construction for over 140 years and won't be complete until 2026. This basilica defies every rule of traditional architecture. Its organic forms, kaleidoscope stained glass, and forest-like columns create a space that feels alive. It's architecture as prayer.",
  
  'spain_alhambra': "A palace so beautiful, the last Moorish king wept as he left it. The Alhambra is Islamic architecture at its zenith - intricate tilework, serene courtyards, and gardens that whisper of medieval Granada's glory. Every arch, every fountain tells a story of a lost civilization's sophistication.",
  
  'egypt_pyramids_of_giza': "Built 4,500 years ago without modern machinery, the Great Pyramid is a miracle of ancient engineering. How did they move 2.3 million stone blocks? How is it so precisely aligned with the stars? Standing before these tombs of pharaohs, you'll feel the weight of millennia and the mystery of human ambition.",
  
  'japan_mount_fuji': "Japan's sacred mountain, perfectly symmetrical, eternally snow-capped. For centuries, pilgrims have climbed its slopes seeking spiritual enlightenment. On clear days, this volcanic cone rises above the clouds like a painting come to life. It's more than a mountain - it's the soul of Japan.",
  
  'usa_statue_of_liberty': "France's gift to America stands as the ultimate symbol of freedom and hope. For millions of immigrants arriving by ship, Lady Liberty was their first glimpse of a new life. Her torch still lights the way, her broken chains still symbolize liberation. She's not just a statue - she's a promise.",
  
  'usa_grand_canyon': "One mile deep, 277 miles long, and carved over 6 million years by the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon's layered red rocks tell 2 billion years of Earth's history. Stand on the rim at sunrise and watch the canyon walls ignite in gold and crimson. It's a humbling reminder of nature's raw power.",
  
  'australia_sydney_opera_house': "Those iconic white sails weren't easy to build - the Opera House took 14 years and cost 14 times the budget. Danish architect Jørn Utzon never saw his masterpiece completed. Today, it hosts 1,500 performances annually and defines Sydney's harbor like nothing else. Controversial then, beloved now.",
  
  'australia_great_barrier_reef': "The only living structure visible from space. This 2,300-kilometer ecosystem is home to 1,500 fish species, 400 types of coral, and endless marine life. Snorkel or dive here and you'll swim through an underwater rainbow. But hurry - climate change threatens this natural wonder.",
  
  'uk_big_ben': "The nickname of the Great Bell inside Elizabeth Tower, Big Ben has rung almost every hour since 1859. Its chimes are the sound of London itself. The clock is so accurate, it's used to set other clocks across Britain. When it falls silent (rare), the whole nation notices.",
  
  'uk_tower_of_london': "A fortress, a palace, a prison, an execution site - the Tower has been witness to 1,000 years of British history's darkest moments. Anne Boleyn lost her head here. The Crown Jewels sleep in its vaults. Ravens guard its walls (legend says if they leave, the kingdom falls). History lives here.",
  
  'china_forbidden_city': "For 500 years, common people were forbidden to enter this palace where 24 emperors ruled China. Inside its vermillion walls lie 980 buildings, each more magnificent than the last. The throne room, the imperial gardens, the ceremonial halls - this is power made architecture.",
  
  'greece_santorini': "A volcanic island that literally exploded 3,600 years ago, creating one of Earth's most dramatic landscapes. White-washed buildings cling to cliff edges above the deepest blue sea. Sunset here is a nightly miracle - the sky burns orange, pink, and purple as the sun melts into the Aegean. Paradise is real.",
  
  'greece_acropolis': "Perched above Athens, the Parthenon has watched over Western civilization for 2,500 years. This temple to Athena represents democracy's birthplace and the golden age of ancient Greece. Damaged by wars and time, it still stands proud - a reminder that great ideas outlast empires.",
  
  'china_great_wall_of_china': "Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall is humanity's longest architectural achievement. Built over 2,000 years by millions of workers, many of whom died during construction. Walk along its snaking path through mountains and you'll understand the cost of ambition and the power of determination.",
  
  'japan_tokyo_tower': "Inspired by the Eiffel Tower but painted bright orange and white, Tokyo Tower was Japan's answer to post-war modernization. At 333 meters, it's taller than its French inspiration. From its observation decks, you can see Mount Fuji on clear days. It's Tokyo's beacon, standing tall since 1958.",
  
  'egypt_sphinx': "Who built this massive limestone guardian? Why is its nose missing? The Great Sphinx has watched over the pyramids for 4,500 years, keeping its secrets. With a lion's body and a pharaoh's face, it's Egypt's most mysterious monument. Every theory about its purpose is just that - a theory."
